### Hi there 👋, I'm Kamal OUHNI

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **data engineering enthusiast** with a curious mind and a drive to build meaningful solutions with data. My academic journey started with the foundations of **web development**, and it eventually led me to discover a deep passion for data.

🧭 **My Path So Far**

I began my academic career learning the basics of web development, working with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **PHP**, and exploring modern frameworks like **Laravel** and **Symfony**.  
This foundation taught me to think in terms of structured systems and user-centric design.

Later, during an academic project, I was introduced to **machine learning**—and I instantly knew I had found my passion. From that moment on, I immersed myself in the world of data: building **data pipelines**, designing **data warehouses**, and automating workflows. I’ve also started exploring **cloud technologies** to scale and deploy my work efficiently.

- 🔭 Currently working on projects involving **ETL automation**, **cloud data platforms**, and **AI-powered exploration tools**.
- 🌱 Always learning – currently deepening my knowledge in **orchestration tools** like **Apache Airflow** and **data infrastructure design**.
- ☁️ First steps in **cloud computing** (AWS & GCP basics).
- 💬 I enjoy collaborating on data-driven projects and mentoring when I can.
